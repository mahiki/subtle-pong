## Subtle Pong
>*The Thinker's Pong*

Easy to learn, a lifetime to master; Subtle Pong (or Subtle Table Tennis) is a variant of standard table tennis with a small change to the method of hitting a shot: every shot must hit your own court before crossing the net, like the serve in regular Table Tennis.

### Subtle Pong Rules
Subtle Pong is played according to the normal rules of Table Tennis, with modifications listed below. The traditions of Subtle Pong began when an errant shot hit the duct-work in the ceiling and landed legally in play -- the players decided to play on and count the point for the winner.

#### The guiding principles of subtle pong are:
Subtle play extends rallies, and enjoyment. Subtle pong players play for fun, winning just adds to the level of interest.
Subtle play equalizes skill levels. Few of us are athletic enough or interested enough to hone our skills and enjoy standard table tennis with top players.

Subtle pong is creative and flexible. For players in a game, adjustments to the rules are welcomed, usually agreed upon as a beta test for new ideas.

### Defintions
- **service round:** a round of play divided by increments of points, traditionally 5 points of scoring in a game to win with 21 points
- **subtle shot:** a shot in play that strikes your own court before crossing the net and striking the opponents court. this is like a service shot in normal ping pong
- **power shot:** a normal table tennis shot - strike the ball over the net into the opponent's court
- **power volley:** a return shot that strikes the ball after it crosses the net and before it strikes your own court
- **rotation:** when players switch sides. this is done as in tennis, to equalize the playing terrain during the game.
- **wall shot:** a shot that strikes in this order: paddle - wall - opponent's court
- **subtle wall shot:** same as wall shot, with subtlety: paddle - player's court - wall - opponent's court
the ball can strike the player's court before crossing the net, before or after striking the wall, or both

### Rules
- Service is just like normal pong
- All shots in play must be subtle, or play stops and the opponent gets the point, with the following exceptions:
	+ **Power Shot** - each player may make one power shot per service round
	+ **Wall Shot** Returns - the player returning a wall shot gets an optional free power shot to return.

### beta rules

	+ Free power shot or power volley return
- Power Volley
	+ Cut of the shot and return before it bounces in your court

	+ Power Shot gets free power volley return

### alpha rules
- **subtle doble** a return shot that strikes player's court TWICE before crossing the net
	+high degree of difficulty in testing
